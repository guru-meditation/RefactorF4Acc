This folder TestHarnessBinaries contains the binaries for the test harnesses used to test your code. To run the tests, you need to link the provided binaries with the binaries of your code.

1/ Compile your code in its source folder (i.e. _not_ in the folder TestHarnessBinaries
2/ copy all .o and .hi files into TestHarnessBinaries
    $ cd TestHarnessBinaries
    $ cp <path to your code>/*.hi .
    $ cp <path to your code>/*.o .

3/ Run the link scripts for each test in the tbin folder. For example, to link test_F95SrcIO with your code:
    $ cd tbin
    $ ./link_test_F95SrcIO.sh 
4/ Run the tests, e.g. for test_F95SrcIO
    $ ./test_F95SrcIO
5/ For test_Main, you need to put the output generated by your Main program in TestHarnessBinaries with the _exact_ name module_LES_ocl.f95 and the reference output in  in TestHarnessBinaries/tbin with the _exact_ name module_LES_ocl_REF.f95
