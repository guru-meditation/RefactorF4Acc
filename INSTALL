The source code for RefactorF4ACC is written in Perl and requires v5.16. There are no dependencies and no compilation is required. 

To install RefactorF4ACC:

- Put the script refactorF4ACC.pl in your path
- Put the RefactorF4ACC folder somewhere where Perl will find it (e.g. /usr/local/share/perl5) or put it anywhere and append the path to PERL5LIB in your
.bashrc or similar.

For example, I have /home/wim/bin in my PATH, so I put refactorF4ACC.pl there; and I have PERL5LIB="/home/wim/perl5/lib/perl5" so I put the RefactorF4ACC folder
there.

The directory 'warnings' contains a stub for the 'use warnings qw(unused)' pragma. If you have the proper 'warnings::unused' installed
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/warnings-unused/) you can delete this folder.

The code will actually work with Perl v5.10 and later, if you don't have v5.16 you can search and replace the version. To make it work with older Perl (e.g. v5.8) you will have to replace all occurences of `say` with `print` and add a newline.
